Description/Purpose: For this project, I have created a fake blogging site. With this project, I have worked different areas of 
functionality. There are some pages and functions that users must register with the site to be able to see and use. This project 
also uses data tables created in phpmyadmin. Among its functionality, users are able to register as a member of this made up blog 
and log into the site where they will have access to additional pages and functions only logged in users can see.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server which hosts this 
webpage.

Usage: This project can be used to view a blog webpage and use some of its functionalities, which includes registering 
as a user, and writing posts, searching for users and blogs, viewing/updating user information, viewing all blogs at once. 
You can also choose what type of account you wish to open. Also, there is email verification!

Future Work: For future work, I would like to be work more with the email verification so that messages received do not say Apache
as the sender. Also, I would like to input an a function that allows users to upload photos to their feed, and to their profile.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Graphic Design. One field that employees
in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
